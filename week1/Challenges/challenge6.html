          Wonder when CSS layout techniques will be less of an art and more of a
          science.
        </p>

        <p>
          Earlier this year I first learned that pure CSS art was a thing, and
          it’s safe to say that my mind was officially blown. I didn’t know you
          could do so much with just…CSS?? (…and a little HTML, but mostly CSS!)
        </p>

        <p>
          Naturally I placed CSS art on my learning-to-code bucket list since
          I’m a sucker for anything visual or creative, but with all of the
          algorithms and data structures and fundamental JavaScript concepts to
          learn and study, it was placed on the back burner. This weekend I
          decided to finally give it a try! At first I thought about making some
          cute animals using simple shapes like a koala.

          I thought that I became a CSS master but all my proficiency perception
          is altered when I saw this sHTML/CSS drawing in the style of an
          18th-century oil painting. Hand-coded entirely in HTML & CSS.
