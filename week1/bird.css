/* Answers to the questions/

1 - Which html element(s) did you use for each of the shapes? Why did you use that one/those?

Only div elements, because it was all about boxes and positioning 

2- If you couldn't change the css file that you just created but you are allowed to add a new css file, how would you change the color of the bird?
div #black {
  background-color: blue;
}

3- Can you think of a reason why you sometimes cannot change a css file?
maybe copyrights issues or having a locked / an inaccessible file
